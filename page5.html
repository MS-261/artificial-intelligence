        <h4 align="center">What is an AI engineer?
            An artificial intelligence engineer is an individual who works with traditional machine learning techniques like natural language processing and neural networks to build models that power AI–based applications. 
            
            The type of applications created by AI engineers include: 
            
            Contextual advertising based on sentiment analysis
            Language translation 
            Visual identification or perception
            Is an AI engineer a data engineer or scientist? 
            You may be wondering how the role of an AI engineer differs from that of a data engineer or a data scientist. While all three roles work together within a business, they do differ in several ways: 
            
            Data engineers write programs to extract data from sources and transform it so that it can be manipulated and analyzed. They also optimize and maintain data pipelines.  
            Data scientists build machine learning models meant to support business decision making. They are often looking at the business from a higher strategic point than an AI engineer typically would.
            What does it take to be an AI engineer?
            AI engineering is a relatively new field, and those who currently hold this title come from a range of backgrounds. The following are some of the traits that many have in common. 
            
            Education
            Many AI engineers moved over from previous technical roles and often have undergraduate or graduate degrees in fields that are required for those jobs. These include: 
            
            Computer science
            Statistics
            Applied mathematics
            Linguistics 
            Cognitive science 
            Most of the above degrees have some relevance to artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
            
            Technical skills
            Two of the most important technical skills for an AI engineer to master are programming and math/statistics. 
            
            Programming: Software developers moving into an AI role or developers with a degree in computer science likely already have a grasp on a few programming languages. Two of the most commonly used languages in AI, and specifically machine learning, are Python and R. Any aspiring AI engineer should at least be familiar with these two languages and their most commonly used libraries and packages.
            Math/statistics: AI engineering is more than just coding. Machine learning models are based on mathematical concepts like statistics and probability. You will also need to have a firm grasp on concepts like statistical significance when you are determining the validity and accuracy of your models.
            Soft skills
            AI engineers don’t work in a vacuum. So while technical skills will be what you need for modeling, you’ll also need the following soft skills to get your ideas across to the entire organization. 
            
            Creativity – AI engineers should always be on the lookout for tasks that humans do inefficiently and machines could do better. You should stay abreast of new AI applications within and outside of your industry and consider if they could be used in your company. In addition, you shouldn’t be afraid to try out-of-the-box ideas. 
            Business knowledge – It’s important to remember that your role as an AI engineer is meant to provide value to your company. You can’t provide value if you don’t really understand your company’s interest and needs from a strategic and tactical level. 
            A cool AI application doesn’t mean much if it isn’t relevant to your company or can’t improve business operations in any way. You’ll need to understand your company’s business model, who the target customers and targets are, and if it has any long- or short-term product plans. 
            
            Communication – In the role of an AI engineer, you’ll have the opportunity to work with groups all over your organization, and you’ll need to be able to speak their language. For example, for one project you’ll have to: 
            Discuss your needs with data engineers so they can deliver the right data sources to you.
            Explain to finance/operations how the AI application you’re developing will save costs in the long run or bring in more revenue.
            Work with marketing to develop customer-focused collateral explaining the value of a new application.
            Prototyping – Your ideas aren’t necessarily going to be perfect on the first attempt. Success will depend on your ability to quickly test and modify models until you find something that works.</h4
